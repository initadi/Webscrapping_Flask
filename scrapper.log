I'll buy more to gift my friends and colleagues.This is a conventional style of pen which my Grandfather (Advocate)used to work with. He gifted me one of his pen which I used and worked with for years. And lastly I lost that pen. Since then (almost 7-8 years) I was looking for this Pen.Thanks Indeed.Himanshu"}, {'Product': 'parkerpen', 'Name': 'Rustam Maishnam', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'very comfortable ball pen', 'Comment': 'I am using this pen since many years and it is very comfortable to handle. Wish to buy another one for stock. A few merit points of this pen:1. small in size which is very comfortable to hold by fingers2. classic style that looks unique and antique3. the material is good and not easily breakable'}, {'Product': 'parkerpen', 'Name': 'Arvind Singh', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'The Best Parker I ever had...', 'Comment': "A simple but charming Pen. Excellent even for daily use. You can use this for extended note taking sessions or just for signatures.The build quality and Flipkart delivery is also excellent.I'm ordering my second one...Instead of buying other fancy Parkers, definitely go for this one !"}, {'Product': 'parkerpen', 'Name': 'nanda', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Simple and elegant', 'Comment': 'Old and Classic style. Simple and elegant. It may not be visible as a strong and beautiful writing pen. But when you write you can feel yourself the strength of simplicity and flow of handwriting. Good pen, hope to have it for a long time.'}, {'Product': 'parkerpen', 'Name': 'Joydipta Banerjee', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Excellent pen!! Highly recommended.', 'Comment': 'This is a marvelous ball pen. Excellent body....timeless design!! Reminds me of my younger days where I used this for my 10th & 12th exam. OLD IS GOLD. I will recommend this pen to anyone. Just use it . You will love it. The jotter refill takes time to become smooth. So be patient. Highly recommended.'}, {'Product': 'parkerpen', 'Name': 'Siddhi Patel', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Its Amazing', 'Comment': 'Really guys its 2 good pen i liked it 2 much.In single word, Brand speaks quality itself.I cant define all its features in review.Everyone should take this its really good.And Parker is the brand name so it will defiantly nice one and Ball pen is the thing which everyone need daily so i suggest every one to take it and it also looks good in your pocket'}, {'Product': 'parkerpen', 'Name': 'Abhilash Sahu', 'Rating': '1', 'CommentHead': 'Poor Quality', 'Comment': "The build quality is poor and ink is also not so good. The size is also a bit smaller than what it appears to be in the picture.Definitely doesn't worth the price...very nice Parker pens are available at that price.Doesn't seem like Parker too!!"}, {'Product': 'parkerpen', 'Name': 'Nipun Gupta', 'Rating': '2', 'CommentHead': 'Poor Ink Flow', 'Comment': 'Service from Flipkart Excellent. Although the pen looks good, but the ink is not upto the mark. I think parker beta is better when it comes to writing long hours. I think this pen is for those  who only have to write 1-2 letters per day. But for that also, go for Parker vector Rolller.. its far better'}, {'Product': 'parkerpen', 'Name': 'Kapisoor Singh', 'Rating': '4', 'CommentHead': 'Nice product', 'Comment': "Sturdy pen with leak-proof design to carry in pocket. Clicking mechanism is long lasting. I've been using one for last 4 years! Parker jotter refil is costly. I use other local / cheaper refills with finer 0.6mm tip which I find better. Though there is a slight misfit in length of the other brand refills (they are about 1 to 2mm longer). I think Parker purposefully builds smaller refills/pens so that you buy only theirs!"}, {'Product': 'parkerpen', 'Name': 'Pradipta Kumar Das', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'antic item of ancient time', 'Comment': 'i have been looking for this from my childhood.. i saw this pen a few years ago,i had a dread of it.finally flipkart made my dream come true.and i owe for this.brilliant item,its too cheap. as well as nice delivery( on the next day).flipkart you won my heart.nothing more to say.. love this pen and flipkart indeed .'}, {'Product': 'parkerpen', 'Name': 'No Name', 'Rating': 'No Rating', 'CommentHead': 'No Comment Heading', 'Comment': 'i have been looking for this from my childhood.. i saw this pen a few years ago,i had a dread of it.finally flipkart made my dream come true.and i owe for this.brilliant item,its too cheap. as well as nice delivery( on the next day).flipkart you won my heart.nothing more to say.. love this pen and flipkart indeed .'}]
